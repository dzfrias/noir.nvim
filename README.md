A smooth, grey-toned colorscheme for [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).
noir.nvim was designed with the intent of simplicity and elegance, with only a
few colors populating your screen.

I created this colorscheme because I wanted to try something a bit more simple,
while still being modern (supporting treesitter, LSP highlight tokens, common
neovim plugins, and more).
